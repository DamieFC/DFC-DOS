# MS-DOS v2.0 Source Code for Continued Development
This repo contains the source-code and compiled binaries for DFC-DOS v1.0, but was originally just MS-DOS v2.0.

These are the same files [originally shared at the Computer History Museum on March 25th, 2014]( http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/microsoft-ms-dos-early-source-code/) and are being (re)published in this repo to make them easier to find, reference-to in external writing and works, and to allow exploration and experimentation for those interested in early PC Operating Systems. I changed the source code to just v2.0.

## Contribute!
The source files in this repo are up for development! If you want to contribute, I could have some help with the following (but please leave some of the additional comments and typos, they're funny!): 

1. Adding interenet connection
2. Adding drivers for USB, Aux, and anything else more modern
3. Heck, why not add a GUI (Instead of Windows, Panes?...)!

(Also, I don't know any Assembly language, so...)
